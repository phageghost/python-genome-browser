1. Ensure compatibility with all versions of Ensembl GFF3
2. Add GTF support
3. Add support for stranded data
4. Auto-scale heights of gene models
5. Add flag for fill-beneath and make default.
6. Shrink logo.
7. Look into eliminating requirement for seaborn (at this point I think we only use the styles).
